## Bot

> Zenith automation bot built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot).

Now it can handle:
* automatically add new issues to the project
* update progress when issue is updated
* update tracked_in when child issue is updated (but not vice versa)
* update milestone for child issues when parent issue is updated by following rules:
   - it triggers when parent issue was edited or get a new milestone (empty or not)
   - id updates milestone only for opened issues
   - child issue's milestone will be updated if child issue doesn't have a milestone or if it's milestone matches with parent (last edit wins)
   - for child issues from another repo it tries to find milestone with same name as parent's
  NB: there might be problems with transferred issues with child issues.

The bot is also responsible for deploy notifications, so make sure to configure it correctly.

## Scripts

`./sync_issues.rb` -- walks over all open issues in cloud and neon repos and add them to https://github.com/orgs/neondatabase/projects/6. Also sets `Tracked In` field if current issue is subtask of some other issue.

Tested with ruby 2.7.3 but expected to work all 2.x/3.x versions.

In order for script to access github you need to:
1. install github cli: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
1. give it api write access:
    ```
    gh auth login --scopes "write:org"
    ```
1. clone this repository
1. make the sync script executable:
    ```
    chmod +x sync_issues.rb
    ```

## Relevant info

Some guides on using API to manage projects: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/using-the-api-to-manage-projects

Issue-related events in github actions: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues

It is handy to use https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer to check GraphQL queries.

E.g. following query would print field id's in our project

```graphql
query {
  organization(login: "neondatabase"){
    projectV2(number: 89) {
      id,
      title,
      fields(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          ... on ProjectV2Field {
            id,
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
